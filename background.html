<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>Born on May 19, 1870 in Washington, D.C., Albert Fish didn’t start out with much of a 
comforting life. He was the youngest of four siblings: Annie Fish, Walter Fish, and Edwin Fish. 
He lived the first years of his life with both his parents, but that didn't last for long. When he
 was 5 years old his father, who was nearing his 80s, died suddenly of heart attack. His father was 
 a boat captain and fertilizer manufacturer and without his father's help, Albert’s mother couldn’t 
 take the burden of four kids on her own and so it wasn’t soon after that Albert was moved into an 
 orphanage. This orphanage would be a major turning point in Albert’s life, for it was here that he 
 grew his love of beatings from others and also himself. He grew very fond of self infliction and before 
 even reaching age 10 Albert was hurting himself for pleasure. While at the orphanage, the kids teased 
 him for his addiction to pain and considered it odd. It was until age 9 that Albert was taken out of the 
 orphanage, when his mom got a government job. At age 12 he engaged in his first homosexual relationship 
 with a telegraph boy. While in this relationship, the boy taught Albert about things like urolagnia and 
 coprophagia. He began the habit of visiting public baths in which he could watch other boys undress. 
 By this age, Albert was engaging in all types of weird habits which developed him later in life. </p>

<h3>Middle Age</h3>
<p>As far as school, Albert never really was big on school. He did enough to graduate highschool but 
formal education was never his style. It wasn't too long after high school that Albert looked for work 
in the big city of New York. He found that work in male prostituting, that's how he got majority of 
his money, and in the miss of it all start molesting and raping young boys. But Albert wouldn't live 
this life for long. Thanks to mom, he was set up with an arranged marriage in 1898 to Anna Mary Hoffman. 
With her he had six children: Anna Gertrude, Eugence, John, and Henry Fish. Albert quit his working ways 
and became a house painter, however, he was still up to his devilish ways - molesting children now most 
were under age 6. In 1903, at age 33, Albert was arrested for grand larceny and incarcerated at Sing Sing 
Correctional Facility. He eventually got out, and still undercover with his devil ways, continued his madness. 
In 1910, he took advantage of and cut off the penis of a man named Thomas Kedden - Fish’s feen for touture was 
a brewing. The final straw was his wife leaving him in 1917, from there Alberts life went downhill.</p>

<h3>Old Age/Time of Terror</h3>
<p>Soon after his wife left him, he started hearing things; he also began self-harming by sticking 
needles into his groin and abdomen. He even went as far to stick wool covered in lighter fluid in his 
butt which he then lit. Although he never did anything physical to his children he encouraged them 
in sadistic games. His obsession with cannibalism started around this time as he grew a liking to eating 
raw meat. His addiction for pain grew and in 1919 he stabbed and disabled boy in Georgetown Washington, D.C.. 
Five years later his reign of terror began in 1924. His first attempt to abduct a victim failed as he tried to 
take eight year old Beatrice Kiel, but his family scared him away. It wasn’t soon after that year that he would 
abduct and take Francis McDonnell. When found the little 9 year old boy was in a tree hanging. He was sexually 
abused and had lacerations all over his body. A friend of Francis noted to the police that a grey old man took 
his friend, a clue police wouldn’t think anything of until later. Fast forward 3 years to 1927, when 4 year old 
Billy Gaffney went missing and was never found. Albert had abducted him, taken him to the dumps in a house all 
alone, tortured him, and feasted on the boy as a dinner meal later that night. Fast forward one more year to 1928 
and Grace Budd. A story in which Gracee Budd was not Albert’s first choice of victim. He was focused on her brother 
but he got her instead. He was supposed to be taking her to a birthday party, but that never happens. He took her 
to an empty house, stripped her naked, tortured her and ate her. He had later stated that he didn't rape although 
the thought came across his mind.</p>

<h3>Life Goes On, Until it Doesn’t Anymore</h3>
<p>3 years later Albert would be married to Estella Wilcox but would only a week later get divorced. It was in this 
same year that Albert sent a letter to a black woman and in return was sent to Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital. He was never 
diagnosed and was released. His life went on until 1934 when Albert decided to write the parents of Grace Budd a vivid and 
descriptive letter of his doings to Grace Budd. He was caught and didn’t fail to confess to his wrong doings. He would go on 
trail for Grace Budd and others he confessed to (he confessed to many more but never was confirmed) in 1935. He pleaded insanity 
but it didn't go through. It was on January 16, 1936 that Albert Fish would be executed via electric chair.</p>
